Synapse revolutionizes AI interaction by moving beyond linear, single-threaded chats. It enables users to **branch, merge, and navigate** through multiple conversation timelines, creating a non-linear exploration space for complex problem-solving, research, and creative work. This project is being developed for the **TiDB AgentX Hackathon 2025**.
