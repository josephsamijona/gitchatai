# Security Policy

## Overview

The security of the Synapse platform and its users' data is a top priority. This document outlines our security policy, including how we handle data, manage vulnerabilities, and the best practices we follow.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it to us privately to protect the project and its users.

- **Email:** `security@synapse-project.com` (placeholder)
- **Encryption:** Please use PGP encryption for sensitive information.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability, including its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (e.g., code snippets, screenshots, or a proof-of-concept).
- Any potential mitigations you have considered.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Data Security

### Encryption

- **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmitted between the client and the server is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Encryption at Rest:** All user-generated content, including conversations, documents, and knowledge graph data, is encrypted at rest in our databases and storage systems.

### Access Control

- **Authentication:** User access is protected through a robust authentication system. We encourage the use of strong, unique passwords.
- **Authorization:** Access to data within the platform is strictly governed by role-based access control (RBAC). Users can only access projects and conversations they are explicitly a part of.

## Secure Development Practices

### Dependency Management

- We use `npm` to manage our dependencies.
- We regularly scan our dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`.
- We strive to keep all dependencies up-to-date to incorporate the latest security patches.

### Code Reviews

- All code changes are submitted via pull requests and must be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged into the main branch.
- Code reviews focus on security, performance, and adherence to coding standards.

### Environment Variables

- All sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, and secret keys, are stored in environment variables and are not hard-coded in the source code.
- The `.env` file is included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data.

## Infrastructure Security

- **Hosting:** The application is deployed on Vercel, which provides a secure, managed infrastructure.
- **Database:** We use TiDB Cloud, which offers a secure, serverless database environment with built-in security features.

This security policy is a living document and will be updated as our platform evolves.
